So I grew up using a Tandy Color Computer 3 as my main computer during a time when most other people had DOS PCs. When friends wanted to share files with me, I had to tell them that my computer couldn't read their disks. It wasn't until many years later that I discovered that there WERE actually tools that could read/write MS-DOS compatible disks using a CoCo, however <b>making</b> a DOS floppy from an unformatted disk was another story. I only know of one other set of tools under OS-9 that could do this, the 3rd-party sdisk3 driver combined with the MSF file manager software, but setting that up is non-trivial and doesn't seem to run on modern NitrOS-9 builds. And so the idea for DOSFormat was born. My tool does not require any special drivers or system configurations. It will work on any stock version of NitrOS-9. For fun, I also used the same text output layout that the real MS-DOS format command uses. Long live the floppy disk! ðŸ˜€
